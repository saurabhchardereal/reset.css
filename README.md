## `reset.scss`

This is my personal CSS reset that I use in react/next projects. I tend to avoid excessive stripping out/reset of most useragent styling as they should be done explicitly on individual elements/components and not globally via a css reset. Also I do not support Internet Explorer (and you shouldn't too!).
